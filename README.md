# Hiroaki's toolbox

## What this?
This scirpt contains scripts that I'm usually using at my work and hobby.

## Why?
Because I don't like doing same thing, and I noticed I ate all the day for
environment creation. I don't think this situation is healthy, and I felt
I needed something like "Packaged gulp tasks" and so on.

## Notice when you use this script.
Please don't use this script unless you know what this script is what you are
doing. This script contains a lot of kludge. For listing tasks, you can use
[gulp-help].
