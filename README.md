## What this?
This scirpt contains scripts that I'm usually using at my work and hobby.

## Why?
Because I don't like doing same thing, and I found I ate all the day for
environment creation. I don't think this situation is healthy, and I felt
I needed something like "Packaged gulp tasks" and so on.

## Notice when you use this script
Don't use this script unless you know what this script is and
what you are doing. This script contains a lot of kludge. For listing tasks,
you can use [gulp-help].

## How to use it
1. Read [src]
2. Read [src] twice (Reading code is the most important than others.)
3. Understand [src]
4. Understand [src] twice (Understanding code is important to use.)

[src]: ./src
